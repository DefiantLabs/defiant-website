text: "I'm thankful that Defiant Labs introduced me to the Crypto Space. With his council, I've been able to make informed decision on my investments and make the most out of my positions. To this day I still reach out to Dan for his guidance and outlook on the DeFi space. He's always ahead of the curve and really connected with the community. I recommend reaching out to Defiant Labs for Crypto & DeFi. Your future self will thank you."
