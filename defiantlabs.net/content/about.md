### Defiant Labs is a growing company made up of talented individuals with different backgrounds. We are looking to give back to the DeFi community by building tools. We truly believe our tools will make mainstream adoption easier.





#### Current Projects

Defiant Labs develops tax software that provides CSV formatted spreadsheets for the Cosmos ecosystem including the Osmosis blockchain. The CSV data includes taxable information for a given Osmosis blockchain address, compatible with popular tax software such as Accointing and Intuit TurboTax.

Some specific features:

* Taxable data for Osmosis Liqudity pool bonding/unbonding and rewards (including superfluid staking)
* Tracking of swap fees for liquidity pool swap transactions
* Tracking of arbitrage related capital gains (on Osmosis DEX)
* Accointing and TurboTax compatible CSVs with Osmosis specific data (as above)
* REST APIs (middleware) for retrieving data (as above)
