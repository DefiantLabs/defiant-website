            make informed decision on my investments and make the most out of my positions. To this day I still reach 
            out to Dan for his guidance and outlook on the DeFi space. He's always ahead of the curve and really connected 
            with the community. I recommend reaching out to Defiant Labs for Crypto & DeFi. Your future self will thank you."

      content : "Defiant Labs has an incredible way to digest information from all sources and separate the noise from 
            the worthwhile information, which is amazing in the crypto space where there are so many “noisy” sources. After 
            obtaining good information, he then has the mental capacity to synthesize the information into repeatable formulas 
            to find efficiencies and gain the most profit. Anytime I’m trying something new in the Defi/Crypto space I always consult 
            with Defiant Labs because I’m sure he’s already 10 steps ahead."

            that lie with the LUNA and ATOM networks is next to none when compared to others within the space. When it comes to alternative 
            investing and how one goes about tax preparation he knows all the in’s and outs. I would fully recommend his services to anyone I 
            know investing in the crypto space."

            design a portfolio of assets that meets my growing families’ needs. He is easy to talk to and provides professional consults over video chat 
            to help me keep my portfolio organized. Dan has also helped me to understanding how taxes are applied to my investment gains and losses in crypto. 
            I would strongly recommend partnering with Defiant Labs for anyone who wants to understand more about crypotcurrencies, NFTS, decentralized finance, 
            cryptocurrency taxes and regulations, as well as technical aspects of blockchain technology."
